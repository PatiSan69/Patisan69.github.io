<p>What is a participle adjective?:</p>

<pre><code>The differences in meaning in &quot;Ing&quot; and &quot;Ed&quot;.
</code></pre>

<p>When we develop the types of verbal tense and his meaning we say that present participle in a verb is built with Ing and the past participle is build with Ed. This same rule could be followed with adjective. But we need to be careful!</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Exciting ; excited</p></li>

<li><p>Amusing; amused.</p></li>

<li><p>Boring; bored.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>These three words (adjective) have the same meaning??</p>

<p>No, have differences but, which are?</p>

<p>When we add &ldquo;ed&rdquo; and adjective we make reference at past participle of the adjective and these mean that we talk about the feeling that feels inside us because something causes it and that cause is expressing with add &ldquo;ing&rdquo; is an adjective that is known like present participle. In example:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>When I eat icecream I feel excited.</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>The iceacream is exciting.</em></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>But in some cases, we can confunsed when we need to use a participle because like the title said we word with participle and they can be verbs or adjectives, so we need to be careful about the correct use of this participle and pay attention and how we use this words.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>They are laughing.</em></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>In this sentence, <strong><em>laughing</em></strong> is a verb or and adjective?.</p>

<p>How we can know this?</p>

<p>Well, this is tricky point and in the beginning is a little confused but exist a proof that is known like &ldquo;the very test&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The very test consist in add before the participle and adverb and that adverb is &ldquo;very&rdquo;. if we add this adverb and the sentence look like make sense in this case we have and adjective, in the oposite case is a verb</p>

<p>So, In the sentence, &ldquo;laughing&rdquo; is?</p>

<p>Is an verb.</p>

<p>In this link, we can see example that help us go deeper in this topic.</p>
