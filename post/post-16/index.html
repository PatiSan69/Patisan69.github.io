<p>For the correct write in English you must know the correct use of every prepositions in English grammar and this could be a little confuse.</p>

<p>A preposition is a word used to link nouns, pronouns or phrases with other words in a sentences. The prepositions can change depending of the context, situation or time that you want to express.</p>

<p>If we want simplify this problem we can clasified in 3 parts:</p>

<h3 id="prepositions-with-transportation">Prepositions with transportation</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>on</p></li>

<li><p>in</p></li>
</ol>

<p>We can use &ldquo;on&rdquo; with open spaces and platforms and in closed spaces we use &ldquo;in&rdquo;.</p>

<p>look this example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>*Mari is the best friend that I have and she go <strong>in motocycle</strong> to class*</p></li>

<li><p>*I had been acamping when john came to the town. He travel <strong>on bus</strong>*.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It can be a little tricky because you can say that a bus is closed spaces but es big and in English we put with &ldquo;on&rdquo;.</p>

<h3 id="prepositions-with-units-of-time">Prepositions with units of time</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>at</p></li>

<li><p>in</p></li>

<li><p>on</p></li>
</ol>

<p>With at we can express hours.</p>

<p>With in we can express weeks, months, years and decades.</p>

<p>With on we can express days</p>

<p>lesÂ´t see this example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>I was in the shopping mall at 5:00 pm</strong></p></li>

<li><p><strong>I had talked with him at 2:00am</strong></p></li>

<li><p><strong>The last week I met with John and He said that in one months he will go to japan</strong></p></li>

<li><p><strong>On friday night I go to party in my university. I feel excited about this!!!</strong></p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="placement-of-prepositions-in-a-sentence">Placement of prepositions in a sentence.</h3>

<p>In this topic we can talk about prepositions phrases. Prepositions phrases are prepositions with the noun that go with them.</p>

<p>In a sentence we can have an adverb and adjective. like this</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>the house with the big door in my neighborhood is always open in the morning</em></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>In this example we can see that we have a noun that in this case is the house, next to him come the adjective &ldquo;the big door in my neighborhood&rdquo; we are describe the main subject of the sentence that is the house, then we have the verb of the sentence &ldquo;is always open&rdquo; and we have the adverb of the sentence &ldquo;in the morning&rdquo; that describe the verb in the sentence. If you can pay attention you can see that we put this sentence with a order and is true!!. This is the correct order to make a sentence in English.</p>

<p>So, prepositions phrases have the following order:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Manner</p></li>

<li><p>Place.</p></li>

<li><p>Time</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Let&rsquo;s go see an example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>The little kid in a blue shirt run all days in the afternoon</em></strong></p></li>

<li><p><strong><em>The final test in my university is tomorrow in the morning</em></strong></p></li>
</ul>
