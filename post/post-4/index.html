<p>When we need to express the development of an ACTIVITY that began in the past and progress right now. We can use the present perfect progressive, also we can use this type of verbal tense when we want to express the duration of the activity. With continuous we have use &ldquo;Ing&rdquo; at the end of the main verb in the sentence that is known as the present participle form of the verbs. The structure of this verbal tense is the following:</p>

<p>subject + Has/have + been + Present participle of the main verb.</p>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><em>I have been working all the day and I feel tired.</em></p></li>

<li><p><em>Every day is more close at the day of the party and I have been organizing all the things and because of that I not be able to talk to you.</em></p></li>
</ul>

<p>With this verbal tense we cannot use stative verbs. Why is that??</p>

<p>Because this verbal tense express ACTIONS!! so we can use just action verbs (ing).
With this verbal tense, we can use for and since as in Present perfect.</p>

<p>We use FOR with a noun of time.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>I have been cleaning for 3 hours.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>And since with a specific time. Like this:.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>They have been writing the book since 2015.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>This is an interview, If you have the time I recommended listen and practice your English. We can see a lot of rules about English grammar in this video. For example, in minute 1:40 the interview said: &ldquo;I have been clinician for a very long time&rdquo;.</p>
