    <section class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>This verbal tense look similar with present perfect progressive, but in this verbal tense we talk about an action or situation that develop in one moment different that right now. With this verbal tense, we can talk about activities or actions that occurs in  the past and continues happen in the past tense and just like in present perfect progressive we can use since and for, with this, we can make reference about that the activity was had not finished in that time. the structure have three main parts:</p>

<pre><code>Had + been + main verb plus ING (Present participle)
</code></pre>

<p>It is important to notice that when we use it since and for with this verbal tense (Progressive tense) we talk about unfinished action in that time, but when we talk about and actions finished in at time we can not use this prepositions.
For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>She had been study biology for 5 years when she got the job.</em></p></li>

<li><p><em>The last week in the job I had been crying all day when the most handsome guy get in of the store and talked with me. It was a great talk!.</em></p></li>
