This definition could be a little confused but we can see better with an example:(example1)</p>

<ul>
<li><em>When John came to home, I had eaten the dinner.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The estructure of this verbal tense is the following:</p>

<pre><code>Subject + had + past participle of the main verb.
</code></pre>

<p>Be carefull!</p>

<p>When the time in the sentence is clear, it is usually wrong to use the past perfect tense.</p>

<p>This mean something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Jane and I was in the shoppingmall last week when she fed in the stairs of the mall. All of the people in the surroundings come and help Jane while I call at emergency.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Look! Since the beginning, we have known that the actions develop in the past, so in this case, it is not necessary to use the structure of the past perfect</p>

<p>Pay attention: We use this verbal tense when we need to express an action that happen first that other action in the past (example 1).</p>
