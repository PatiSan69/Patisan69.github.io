        XVI. Prepositions
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      For the correct write in English you must know the correct use of every prepositions in English grammar and this could be a little confuse.
A preposition is a word used to link nouns, pronouns or phrases with other words in a sentences. The prepositions can change depending of the context, situation or time that you want to express.
If we want simplify this problem we can clasified in 3 parts:

        XV. Nouns
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      The nouns are the basic buildings blocks of a a sentence. there are person, things, animals, emotions, places, thoughts. In a sentence we could describe a thing and that thing is know as nouns.
With nouns exist a several rules that we need to know when we want to express something in a sentence with correct form. With nouns we have counts and non-counts nouns.
What is this??
Nouns are classsified in counts, this mean that we can count the noun.

        XIV. Pronouns
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Sometimes in a text, we need to replace a noun with other word because sometimes could be repetitive the use of the same noun in the same sentence. For example, this could be one situation that can explain this topic: &ldquo;Maria is my best friend, she and her father are been watching a tv series and she say me that the series are very fun&rdquo;. Look like we refer Maria in two occasion with &ldquo;Her&rdquo;, her is a pronoun.

        XIII. Phrasal verbs
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      In English, we have another type of verb and this are known as phrasal verbs. These groups of verbs generally have two words like this &ldquo; Get up&rdquo;(compound words). With intuition you can say that the meaning of this verb is something like this: &quot;put something up&quot;, but is not, and because of that we need to be careful!.
Phrasal verbs have special meaning and for the person who is trying to learn English this could be a little tricky but with some practice, we can learn some of these verbs.

        XII. Comparatives and superlatives.
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      In english when we need compare two things we can use comparatives and If we need to compare more than two, we use superlatives in the adjective of the sentences.
Comparatives use er and superlatives use est
Example:
 This university of north of california is better than the university of south. (In this examples we are been comparing two things, so we can use er in the end of the adjective).

        XI. Participles adjectives
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      In the last point, we develop what is an adjective, the structure of a sentence with an adjective and how we could make to use this adjective in a correct order now we go to talk about participles adjectives.
What is a participle adjective?:
The differences in meaning in &quot;Ing&quot; and &quot;Ed&quot;.  When we develop the types of verbal tense and his meaning we say that present participle in a verb is built with Ing and the past participle is build with Ed.
