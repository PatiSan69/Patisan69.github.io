        X.  Adjectives

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Now, when we need describe a noun we use adjectives:
 The boy is very big  In this sentence, the adjective is &ldquo;Big&rdquo;. But why?
Because this world describe a noun, in this sentences the noun is a boy. Adjectives can describe singular or plural nouns and can describe pronouns.
 They have a big cat  They is a pronoun. (Pronoun is the same thing that a noun, we talk about this topic in another topic).

        IX. Gerunds and Infinitives

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      In this moment you should be able to know what means the verb plus ing. you can say that is the form of the verb present participle but also we can say that is a gerund.
Gerunds are verbs plus ing. the differences between the other topic that we develop is that in this case (In present perfect continuous we use the present participle of the verb, this mean verb plus &ldquo;ING&rdquo;), they not acting like verbs in a sentences actually, they can act as nouns, subject or the object in a sentences.

        VIII. Modals verbs 
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Modals verbs we can use when we need to express ability, possibility, advice or imposibility. This type of verbs are like helping verbs in a sentence because they are always accompanied by the main verb.
When we use these type of verb the main verb mainteing their original form:
 She can go to the pool.
 My father was able to run 5 milles everyday in the morning.

        VII. Past perfect continuous
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      This verbal tense look similar with present perfect continuous, but in this verbal tense we talk about an action or situation that develop in one moment different that right now. With this verbal tense, we can talk about activities or actions that occurs in the past and continues happen in the past tense and just like in present perfect continuous we can use since and for, with this, we can make reference about that the activity was had not finished in that time.

        VI. Past Perfect
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      When we talk about and action that happened in the past but also we need to show that this action develops in the past before the recent past we can use the past perfect. This definition could be a little confused but we can see better with an example:(example1)
 When John came to home, I had eaten the dinner.  The estructure of this verbal tense is the following:

        V. Present perfect VS Present perfect progressive
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      In the last topic we develop the verbal tense know as present perfect continuous but for the student could be confused the differences and the correct use between the present perfect (is the first topic explained)and present perfect continuous. The reason for this is we can to express and action or event with present perfect and present perfect continuous and in the two forms is correct but because of that it is important to know the differences and similarities between this verbal tense.
