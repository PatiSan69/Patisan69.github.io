<p>Adverbs are word that accompanies the verbs in sentences. They modify the meaning of the verb.</p>

<p>For the moment I want to put like example the following adverbs:</p>

<p>Ever, Never, Yet, Already</p>

<p>With the adverb <strong><em>Ever</em></strong> we can express an experienced at some time in your life:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>I has ever kept in the beach for a week.</em></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/post/2/img1.jpeg" alt="Picture of a beach" /></p>

<p>With this example we can make a idea about the correct use in a sentence of the adverbs.</p>

<p>With <strong><em>Never</em></strong> we can express negative sentence this mean that you not experienced at anytime in your life:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>I has never ridden in motorcicle, but I will</em></li>
</ul>

<p>If we want to express an action not finished but believe you will. We can use the adverb <strong><em>Yet</em></strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>I have not finished my homework yet.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>When you want to express an action that finished and is not need to do it again, we can use the adverb <strong><em>already</em></strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>She has already brush his hair.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Joy Crookes is a songwriter British. Since my point of view she is one of the best artist contemporany. Listen in minute 1:39 how she use an adverb in a sentence</p>
